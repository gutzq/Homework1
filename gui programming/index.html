       Hello, my name is Ryan Gutierrez this is my first webpage. I've done some work with html and 
       javascript in Computer Graphics but never really made a real website aside from the last project which 
       featured a 2-Dimensional shape editor where you could create a variety of shapes. After creation the application
       has several features of saving the canvas as a file and has the ability to change the colors of the images. Aside from This 
       I wanted to take advantage of this oppurtunity and create a webpage about fantasy football. It has been a passion of mine
       for years and has become such a huge hobby of mine during the fall season.
