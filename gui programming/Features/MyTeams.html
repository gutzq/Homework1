        <p>
            After a hard faught week one my team was able to get it done against "The Pick 6 Pack". In the early slate almost everyone
            of my players scored a touchdown(Tyreek, Stefon, Jonathan, Alvin). This put me up early and I held the lead until the 4 o'clock games
            when Nick made a miraculous comeback and somehow took the lead going into the monday night game. In the monday night game all I had 
            left was my kicker Jake Moody and he put 6 field goals through and 2 extra points and got a whopping 26 fantasy points which gave me 
            the edge. 134.84-118.36

        <h1 style= "text-decoration: underline;"> Week one Reviewal on Misfits:</h1>
        <p>
            This game was an array of emotion and wasn't looking very good after the one o'clock slate. I already had Travis Kelce and Zay Flowers play 
            and they didn't do very well at all they only were able to score 17.5 fantasy points combined on Thursday Night Football. So I was relying on guys like 
            Jamaar Chase and Saquon Barkley to perform. Unfortunately Saquon and Joe did and my other players had a tough game 1 luckily my defense was able
            to score 27 fantasy points and give me fighting chance. After Sunday Night Football I was losing by 6 with my quarterback Aaron Rodgers left to play.
            He performed very poorly but since I only needed 6 points I was able to comeout on top. 144.5-140.1
